# MIE1666: Machine Learning for Mathematical Optimization 

These are the lecture notes of this course.

```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/). As such,
these notes are dynamic and can include Python code.

To download the packages that are used in the code, please download the file requirements.txt from [the notes' repository](https://github.com/utoronto-ml4opt/notes), then create a Conda or virtualenv environment using that file; see [this](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-a-requirements-file) for a tutorial.
